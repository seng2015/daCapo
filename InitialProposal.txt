To start, write a 1-2 page project proposal: What software system would you like to build, and why? You should try to find
somebody (the “customer”) who would be interested in using this software system. The customer should help refine the specifications, and should provide feedback (to you) over the
course of the project.

Your initial proposal should include:
• a title: THOTH

• a list of team members:
Nick Maas, Rachel Protacio, Zach Blickensderfer, Xiao Shi

• a description of what problem the system would solve and why this problem is important (and exciting)

• who is your customer, who will test your system
Yale Glee Club, Society of Orpheus and Bacchus, Alley Cats

• a description of what the system would do

• how will you test the system, and how will you demo it
• a brief justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitious for your team to undertake in nine weeks. Remember that your project is not only programming: it
requires writing specification, design and planning, programming, and testing. You should avoid projects that are too easy. One way to ensure that the project is not too
hard, is to have intermediate sets of features where one could stop if running out of time. For projects that might seem too hard, please sketch the major tasks, so that we
can judge that something can be achieved.

Additionally, to address technical issues, such as which programming language to use, or which platform, in your project proposal specify which language and tools you intend to use,
and explain the reasons why. To better understand the background of your team, for each member in the group, please
write:
• languages (Java/C/C++/Perl/Python/Ruby/etc) you know, with gradation ("familiar", "expert", etc)
• environments you are familiar with (Unix, Mac, Windows, Cygwin)
• size (rough estimate) of the largest project you have developed, and the largest project you have been involved with (and the number of people in your project group).
