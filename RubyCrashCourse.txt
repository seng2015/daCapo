ClassNames -- CamelCase
methods and variables -- snake_case
        def faculty_member? ... end
CONSTANTS (scoped) and $GLOBALS (not scoped)
symbols: like immutable string whose value is itself
        e.g. :rails

x = 3
instance and class vars have nil until assigned
array
        x = [1,'two', :three]
        x[1] == 'two'
        x.length == 3

Hash:
        w = {'a'=>1, :b=>[2,3]}
        w[:b][0] == 2
        w.keys == ['a', :b]

Methods def is similar to python's

span line if parsing is unambiguous
        raise("Boom!") unless
          ship_stable

collection.each do |elt| ... end
